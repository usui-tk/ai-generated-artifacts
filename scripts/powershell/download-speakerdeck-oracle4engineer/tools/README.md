## `psa.py` — PowerShell Static Analyzer

A single-file Python 3 static analyzer for PowerShell scripts. Catches the
classes of bugs that the regular PowerShell parser doesn't flag at parse time,
but which routinely break long-running scripts in surprising ways.

This file is **re-used verbatim** from the upstream repository
[`usui-tk/Deploy-AMD-Drivers-For-WindowsServer`](https://github.com/usui-tk/Deploy-AMD-Drivers-For-WindowsServer/blob/main/tools/psa.py),
which is also where its design rationale is maintained. Bug fixes and new
checks should be contributed upstream first; this folder mirrors the latest
upstream version.

### Why a custom analyzer?

Microsoft ships [PSScriptAnalyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/overview),
which is excellent and should be used too. But PSScriptAnalyzer has two
limitations for this project:

1. It requires PowerShell 5.1+ to run (chicken-and-egg if your CI doesn't
   have Windows / PowerShell yet).
2. It catches a different set of issues — primarily style and best-practice
   violations. It does **not** by default catch unbalanced braces in
   4000-line scripts, undefined variable references that are typos, or
   `-match` against a bare `$variable` that returns true on `$null`.

`psa.py` is a Python script (running anywhere Python 3 runs) that performs a
complementary set of checks specifically tuned for this repository's style.
It's not a replacement for PSScriptAnalyzer; it's an extra net.

### Usage

```bash
# Analyze the main script
python3 tools/psa.py Download-SpeakerDeck.ps1

# Analyze the PoC alongside (typical CI invocation)
python3 tools/psa.py Download-SpeakerDeck.ps1 && \
python3 tools/psa.py Test-PdfMetadata.ps1
```

Exit codes:
- `0` — clean (no errors, no warnings)
- `1` — warnings only (CI may treat as soft-fail)
- `2` — errors found (CI must fail)

### Output format

```
==== psa.py: PowerShell Static Analyzer ====
File   : Download-SpeakerDeck.ps1
Lines  : 4106
Issues : 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 info

  (no issues found)
```

Each issue (when present) has a check code (C1–C10), severity, line number,
and short message.

### Checks implemented

| Code | Severity | What it catches | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C1** | error | Brace balance: `{` count vs `}` count | A single unmatched brace in a 4000-line script is impossible to debug by eye. The parser reports it as a syntax error at EOF, not at the actual mismatch. psa.py reports both counts so you can `grep -n '^[}]'` and trace. |
| **C2** | error | Paren balance: `(` vs `)` | Same as C1 but for `()`. |
| **C3** | error | Bracket balance: `[` vs `]` | Same as C1 but for `[]`. |
| **C4** | warning | Undefined variable references (heuristic) | Catches typos like `$matchedDeciks` instead of `$matchedDecks`. Heuristic — false positives possible for `$global:` / `$script:` scoped vars assigned elsewhere. |
| **C5** | warning | Auto-variable shadowing | Assigning to `$args`, `$_`, `$matches`, `$null`, etc. silently breaks PowerShell built-ins. The list of auto-vars is from [about_Automatic_Variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_automatic_variables). |
| **C6** | warning | `Start-Process -ArgumentList` (without `-PassThru` / `Wait-Process` etc.) | `Start-Process` is convenient but mishandles paths with spaces, gives a poor exit code path, and drops stderr. Prefer `[System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start([ProcessStartInfo]@{...})` for any script that needs reliability. |
| **C7** | warning | `-match` against bare `$variable` (e.g. `$line -match $pattern`) where `$pattern` could be `$null` | `$line -match $null` is `True` and **assigns `$matches = $null`**. Wrap with `[string]::IsNullOrEmpty($pattern)` before matching. |
| **C8** | info | TODO / FIXME markers | Just a reminder of pending work. Not a failure. |
| **C9** | warning | Trailing backtick before empty line | The PowerShell line-continuation backtick is fragile. If the next line is blank (visible) or has trailing whitespace, the continuation breaks silently. |
| **C10** | warning | `-match` against literal empty string `""` or `''` | `$x -match ""` is **always True** for any string, including empty. Almost always a coding mistake. |

### What the analyzer does NOT check

- Cmdlet existence (would require a PowerShell session)
- Type correctness (PowerShell is dynamically typed; this is shell scripting, not C#)
- Module imports (`Import-Module` resolution)
- Function signature correctness (param types, mandatory parameters)
- Best-practice style violations (covered by PSScriptAnalyzer)

### Running PSScriptAnalyzer alongside

If you have PowerShell 5.1+ available, run both:

```powershell
# In addition to psa.py
Install-Module -Name PSScriptAnalyzer -Scope CurrentUser -Force
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path Download-SpeakerDeck.ps1 -Severity Warning,Error
```

### Verification status

```
==== psa.py: PowerShell Static Analyzer ====
File   : Download-SpeakerDeck.ps1
Lines  : 4106
Issues : 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 info
```

```
==== psa.py: PowerShell Static Analyzer ====
File   : Test-PdfMetadata.ps1
Lines  :  501
Issues : 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 info
```

Both must remain at `0 errors / 0 warnings / 0 info` before any commit.

### CI integration example

GitHub Actions workflow snippet (Linux runner, no Windows / PowerShell required):

```yaml
name: Lint
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  static-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Run psa.py on main script
        run: python3 scripts/powershell/download-speakerdeck-oracle4engineer/tools/psa.py \
                     scripts/powershell/download-speakerdeck-oracle4engineer/Download-SpeakerDeck.ps1
      - name: Run psa.py on PoC script
