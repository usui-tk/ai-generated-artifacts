# Changelog

All notable changes to `build-ol-aws-ami.sh` are documented in this file.

The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

This project's revision identifier is the `rNN` linear counter encoded in the
script banner.

This CHANGELOG is **English only** per the repository-wide
[documentation language policy](https://github.com/usui-tk/ai-generated-artifacts/blob/main/README.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Made `phase1_install_prerequisites` (build host provisioning) version-aware:
  detection now reads `ID` + `VERSION_ID` from `/etc/os-release` and selects a
  per-OS/version KVM + libguestfs package set. Supported build hosts are the
  latest two generations only - OL/RHEL/Rocky/Alma/CentOS Stream 10/9,
  Fedora 44/43, Ubuntu 26.04/24.04, Debian 13/12; older releases are refused
  with a clear `die`. Ubuntu 26.04 uses `qemu-system` (the `qemu-kvm`
  transitional package was dropped); `bridge-utils` is not installed (libvirt
  default NAT). See SPEC B.6.
- Migrated the subproject from `scripts/aws/ol-aws-ami-builder/` to
  `projects/bash-ol-aws-ami-builder/` and reconstructed the doc-set (README,
  README.ja, SPEC, this CHANGELOG) from the repository template canon
  (template-canon v1.0.0). Added the doc-provenance front-matter pin and rebased
  governance links to absolute URLs. No script behavior changed.
